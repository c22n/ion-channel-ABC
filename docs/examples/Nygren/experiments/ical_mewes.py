    Steady-state activation curve for ical in human
    atrial myocytes [Mewes1994] cf. Fig5c.

    ICa was measured as the inward peak current with reference to the
    current level at the end of the test pulse.

    Current voltage relationships were determined by clamping for 450 ms
    from the holding potential (-40 mV) to different test potentials
    between -30 and +40 mV. Activation plots were generated by dividing
    peak ICa measured at a particular potential by the ion-driving force.
